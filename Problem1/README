# SOEN_6011_Summer_2019 (ID:40057756) F5 : Γ(x) 

Repository for the SOEN 6011(Engineering Process) ,Implemention of Gamma function(F5),Γ(x).

# Definition
The gamma function, Γ(α), for α > 0, is defined as
Γ(α) = Z (Integral I could not put the sign) but it is equal with the below formula
Γ(α) = (α − 1)Γ(α − 1)

The gamma function satisfies the recursive property
Γ(α) = (α − 1)Γ(α − 1)

When α = n and n is a positive integer, then the gamma function is related to the factorial function:
Γ(n) = (n − 1)!

# Characteristics
The gamma function can be seen as a solution to the following interpolation problem:

"Find a smooth curve that connects the points  {\displaystyle (x,y)} (x,y) given by {\displaystyle y=(x-1)!} {\displaystyle y=(x-1)!} at the positive integer values for x."

# Domain
Any positive integer n,
positive real

# Sub Domain
R+ , Z+
